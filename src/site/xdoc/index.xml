        <span style="font-weight: bold">Apache DirectMemory</span>
        is a multi layered cache implementation featuring off-heap memory management (a-la BigMemory)
        to enable efficient handling of a large number of java objects without affecting jvm garbage collection
        performance

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>Apache DirectMemory is an effort undergoing
        <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a>
        at
        The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly
        accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
        process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
        While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
        it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
      </p>
      <p>You can view our current
        <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/directmemory.html">incubation status</a>
        for more details.
