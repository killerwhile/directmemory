Create your server instance

  In order to create a war file to serve a DirectMemory instance, you can:

  * package in a maven war project type

  * create it from the archetype

* Server Configuration

  In the first release, the DirectMemory Server use a single instance of DirectMemory cache and configured via System Properties:

  * numberOfBuffers: "directMemory.numberOfBuffers" (default: 10)

  * size: "directMemory.size" (default: 1000)

  * initialCapacity: "directMemory.initialCapacity" (default: 100000)

  * concurrencyLevel: "directMemory.concurrencyLevel" (default: 4)



* Maven War project

  Add a dependency to the server core artifact:

+------------------------
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.directmemory.server</groupId>
    <artifactId>directmemory-server</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
  </dependency>
+------------------------

  Map the DirectMemory servlet in your web.xml:

+------------------------
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>DirectMemoryServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.apache.directmemory.server.services.DirectMemoryServlet</servlet-class>
    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>DirectMemoryServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/cache/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
+------------------------

* Create from archetype

  Use the following command line.

+------------------------
mvn archetype:generate \
   -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.directmemory.server \
   -DarchetypeArtifactId=server-example-archetype \
   -DarchetypeVersion=${project.version}
+------------------------

  If you want to use a SNAPSHOT version you must add: -DarchetypeRepository=https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/

  Now you have a simple war project configured to be a DirectMemory Server.

  Try the provided sample with running mvn tomcat7:run and hit your browser to http://localhost:9091/dm/
