Javascript caching with DirectMemory

  First you must have a server instance installed and available see {{{./server-instance.html}server instance}}.
  Sample here are based on using JQuery library.

  Now you will be able to store/get/delete your json objects in an Apache DirectMemory instance.

%{toc|fromDepth=2}

* Store your object

  Note the header <<<X-DirectMemory-ExpiresIn>>> to specify the ttl value in ms.

* Get your object

* Delete your object
